<p>This Computer Vision model architecture for object detection and segmentation, instance detection and segmentation, pose estimation </p>

### Object Detection and Segmentation
Object detection involves identifying objects within an image or video and drawing bounding boxes around them. Segmentation goes a step further by precisely delineating the boundaries of each object, often pixel by pixel.

### Instance Detection and Segmentation
Instance detection identifies individual instances of objects, such as differentiating between multiple instances of the same object class within an image. Instance segmentation extends this by providing pixel-level segmentation masks for each instance.

### Pose Estimation
Pose estimation focuses on determining the spatial positions and orientations of objects or keypoints within an image. This can include human pose estimation, where the goal is to detect and localize key joints and body parts.

## Model Architecture
The architecture is designed to handle these tasks using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), feature extraction modules, upsampling layers for resolution enhancement, and specialized heads for different outputs (e.g., bounding boxes, masks, keypoints).

Each task typically involves:

<ul>
    <li><b>Backbone</b>: Extracts hierarchical features from input images.</li>
    <li><b>Intermediate Layers</b>: Enhance feature representations. </li>
    <li><b>Task-Specific Heads</b>: Produce final predictions tailored to each task (e.g., bounding box coordinates, segmentation masks, keypoint locations).</li>
</ul>

<p>This versatile architecture leverages deep learning techniques to enable robust and accurate performance across a range of Computer Vision challenges.</p>
